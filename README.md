# companion-project-histoire (simple todo app)

## About

This project demonstrates how to use Histoire with Vue 3 along with different use cases. The application is heavily inspired by [todomvc](https://todomvc.com/examples/vue/).

It is a companion project for my [LogRocket article](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/sebastianweber/) about [Histoire](https://histoire.dev/) to showcase UI components.
